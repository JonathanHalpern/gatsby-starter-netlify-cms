description: Swim in the Solent on Boxing Day
---
This year, we were on the Isle of Wight for Christmas. A land which prides itself on its peculiarities: Cowes you cannot milk, Freshwater you cannot drink and Needles you cannot thread, to name only three. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that a Boxing Day tradition on this whimsical island does not involve comfort and warmth, but rather insists upon throwing yourself into the icy depths of the Solent.

Last year, I was on my period with nothing to wear. Jonny dived in, solo, in his undercrackers. After losing a bet in Ireland, he also had to drink an entire pint of Guinness out a penguin hat (don't ask). Naturally, he combined challenges and so, with his brown and moistened hat thrust onto his head, he was off. When he returned from the waves, freezing, wet, sticky and smelling like an old sea-dog at the local pub, I felt proud, but also a bit jealous.

This year, armed with a tampon and a flamingo costume, I was ready.

Jonny retained his penguin hat for the occasion and we lent my brother another festive fedora. In the name of tradition, we also brought a pint of beer to drink out of the hat before we went in (interestingly, the beer is not drunk - as one might imagine - from the head-hole, but rather by sucking upon the fibrous pompom at the bottom. Although slightly hairy, the experience is not entirely unpleasant). With some Dutch courage warming our bellies, we went for it.

When you're on holiday, you can dip your toe in the sea and, if it feels chilly, you head back to the sunbed. You tell yourself that there is no way you're getting in. With challenges, it's different. The icy sea is up to your thighs before you process that "Holy shit it's cold," and it's only when you got past the tummy-threshold and actually throw yourself in that you realise you can barely move and your breathing is raspy and shallow. Everyone's laughing and screaming, and it's sort of brilliant and horrible all at once.

Getting out is less fun. Or at least, it was for me. Jonny seemed to manage it alright. Perhaps it was the penguin atop his head which inspired him to move as adeptly through icy waters as the ubiquitous bird of the Arctic.

I, on the other hand, was a flamingo. Tropical shrimp-filled streams I can do, frigorific oceans I cannot. (NB: I like 'frigorific'. It is a perfect combination of 'fridge' and 'horrific', which just about sums the whole thing up). I fell over countless times on the shore, where my numb feet - already bearing chilblains from poor circulation and cold weather - were no longer doing a decent job of keeping me upright. And where flamingos are said to stand on one leg, it took me four as my papa kindly allowed me to use him as a human crutch back to dry land.

Overall, I'm glad we did it. We said a sorry farewell to a now rather sad and gritty looking flamingo costume and a beery penguin hat, both of which had been a source of much amusement over the last year. However, it was in the name of a good cause (raising money for the Isle of Wight charity PATCH), and definitely woke us up after a boozy Christmas. You never know, we might even do it again next year, though hopefully in warmer climes!
