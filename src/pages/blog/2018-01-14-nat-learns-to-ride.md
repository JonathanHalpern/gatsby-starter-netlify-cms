Well, it was nowhere near as hard as learning to ride a unicycle… but probably a lot more useful!

Every tourist couple we have seen has a dude riding up front, so naturally I wanted to give it a go. Once you realise that pulling the brakes can cause you to accidentally rev the bike (flashback to a twisted ankle in Greece), it’s actually pretty easy.

Despite not being the most challengey of challenges, Jonny also wanted to film something on his drone, so think of it as a double whammy.

Note:

If my insurance company is reading this, please know that it is a 125CC moped, I have a full driver’s license and – as you can see – I am wearing a helmet.

If mum is reading this, the video actually shows footage of Jonny in my clothes and a wig. Strange, huh? But 100% true.

If dad is reading this, I’m on an 800CC Harley and I’ve slowed the video down to half speed.
