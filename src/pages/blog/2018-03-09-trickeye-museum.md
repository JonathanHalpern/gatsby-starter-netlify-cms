It all began at a museum in Phuket (well, in actual fact, it began with a challenge box in Hackney Road, and a certain Lily Molyneux... but let's not worry too much about that). We were surprised to find Van Gogh's original 'Starry Night' on display at an otherwise limited venue and, to show our appreciation, we sat in the frame of this magnificent work of art.

Little did we know that Van Gogh had been waiting for two such art heathens to do this very thing, and his painting sucked us inside to live in a strange new dimension. Gawping, we found ourselves in an art gallery holding some of the world's most famous artworks... without a security guard in sight! Stranger still was Van Gogh's self-portrait which seemed so full of life that we gravitated towards it. Bizarrely, I felt the urge to reach out and touch Vincent's troubled face. His bandages came away in my hand!

What tempted me then to pull at this poor invalid's bandages I cannot say, except perhaps that I wanted to see in what state his head was, with only one ear. It was a sick fancy and I cannot excuse myself.

However, with this recklessness complete (leaving Vincent looking quite affronted), I could not sate a desire to destroy more artwork

At first Jonny found the whole situation amusing, and even joined in with some silly antics

but after blowing Mona Lisa to smithereens (she always struck me as a a moody old cow anyway), his sense of morality kicked in and he began cleaning up after our mess.

In fact, he got so into his duties, I had to tear him away before he cleaned up the paintings themselves!

After all this hard work, God himself offered Jonny a stiff drink from out of his 'Creation of Adam' painting. Top lad.

Jonny accepted gladly, but after my mischievous behaviour, all I was granted was some cherub's piss.
